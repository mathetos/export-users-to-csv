Export users data and metadata to a csv file.

== Description ==

A WordPress plugin that exports user data and meta data. You can even export the users by role and registration date range. 

Export users by role and optionally set a registration date range.

Export is found in "Tools > Export", or with the "Export Users" button on the Users admin screen.

By default, it does not export user passwords as a security concern. See the [FAQ](#faq) for how to include them regardless.

= Features =

* Exports all users fields
* Exports users meta
* Exports users by role
* Exports users by date range

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use? =

Click on the 'Export Users' button at the top of the 'Users' admin screen, or navigate to "Tools > Export." From there, choose "Users" as your export, then choose the role and the date range. Choose nothing at all if you want to export all users, then click 'Export'. That's all!

= How do I include the Passwords? =

I don't really recommend it since storing passwords in plain-text can be a real liability issue. Nevertheless, you can add this filter to your site to allow the password to be included as a column in your CSV file:

`add_filter('pp_eu_exclude_data', 'my_prefix_include_password');

 function my_prefix_include_password() {
     return array();
 }`
